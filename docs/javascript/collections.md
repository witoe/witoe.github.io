# Javascript Notes

#### 1. [Online version of "Exploring ES6" by Dr. Axel Rauschmayer](http://exploringjs.com/es6/index.html)
>If you really want to understand ES6, you have to understand how each feature works, even when you’re dealing with unusual situations and edge cases. What sets Axel Rauschmayer’s Exploring ES6 apart from other books is that it really cares about the inner workings of ECMAScript. It doesn’t just describe the common use cases that you probably already understand. It digs deep into the semantics and, where necessary, wallows in the edge cases. It explains why features work the way that they work and how they are used in realistic code. Assimilate the material in this book and you will be an ES6 expert.

#### 2. [How do JavaScript closures work under the hood](https://dmitryfrank.com/articles/js_closures)

This is the best article I've read that illustrats how "closures" works and what is going on behind the scene when they're used.

#### 3. [Javascript – How Prototypal Inheritance really works](http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/javascript/how-prototypal-inheritance-really-works.html) (by vjeux)
