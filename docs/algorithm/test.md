::: theorem
If $f$ has derivatives of all orders in an open interval $I$ containing $a$, then for each positive integer $n$ and for each $x$ in $I$,
$$f(x)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k + R_n(x)$$ 
where $R_n(x)=\frac{f^{(n+1)}(c)}{(n+1)!}(x-a)^{n+1}$ for some $c$ between $a$ and $x$.
